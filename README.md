# Random-Password-Generator-HW3

## Description
Aside from practicing some basic coding skills with JavaScript, this random password generator site would be able to assist anyone in developing a random password to help better secure their accounts or information.  The user is able to select how many characters the password may be (between 8 and 128 characters) as well as if that password would have lowercase letters, upppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.

## Installation
No installation needed. It can be accessed at https://bburleigh.github.io/Random-Password-Generator-HW3/.

This screenshot serves as an example of what can be generated if the user wishes to have a 100-character password with all 4 types of characters.

## Usage
In theory, any web user who wishes to randomly generate a strong password quicky without having to spend time "thinking" of a clever password will find this site useful.

## Credits
Aside from my instructor and TA, my Sunday tutor assisted me in fixing the error that initially played when "undefined" was generated a certain number of times (based on the inputted character length). Other than w3school.com, one posting on stackoveflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69851109/js-password-generator-character-length-not-working) was particularly helpful in fixing a few errors and building some of framework.
